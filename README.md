# Plural Vote's Search Trends + Polling Model Predictions

The basis on which Plural Vote's forecast models electoral simulations via posterior distribution estimates is with our unique Search Trends + Polling Model Predictions. Our model depends primarily on polls to predict vote outcomes. Past polling error informs our modelling of the uncertainty of our predictions. In addition to polls, which we weight as 2/3rd of our predictions in our forecast, we incorporate a unique model based on "Media Partisanship". It uses measurements gathered from Google Trends in order to asses media polarization and thus predict vote margins, and it is predictive of past election outcomes. We model the probabilities using the beta, weibull, and logistic distributions. The Electoral College vote and probability is estimated using 20,000 Monte Carlo simulations.
